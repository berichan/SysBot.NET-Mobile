# SysBot.NET-Mobile

### Q & A ###

**What is this?**

SysBot.NET with a Xamarin.Forms frontend for the UI. Currently only works with Android, I don't own an iOS device.

**Is this fully functional?**

No. The only function I've tested is $clone. The only way to stop bots currently is to kill the app.

**Do I need to compile this myself?**

Yes, at least until CI is set up for this (maybe never)

**How do I use it?**

Transfer your config.json from your SysBot.exe folder to your mobile device, then hit the "load config.json" button in the app. All bots (besides YouTube) will start immediately.

**Is there any support for this/are you still working on it?**

No.
