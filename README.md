# SysBot.NET-Mobile

### Q & A ###

**What is this?**

SysBot.NET with a Xamarin.Forms frontend for the UI. Currently only works with Android, I don't own an iOS device.

**Is this fully functional?**

No. The only function I've tested is $clone. The only way to stop bots currently is to kill the app.

**Do I need to compile this myself?**

Yes, at least until CI is set up for this (maybe never)
